        </h1>

        

        <div class="post-content">
            <ul>
<li>PE is a modified version of the <strong>Common Object File Format</strong> (<strong>COFF</strong>), thus also referred to as <strong>PE/COFF</strong>.</li>
<li>The 64-bit version of PE is called <strong>PE32+.</strong></li>
<li>The structure is defined in <strong>WinNT.h</strong>, which is included in the <strong>Microsoft Windows Software Developer Kit</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../../../The_PE_Format/image.png">
<em>PE32+ binary structure.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>MS-DOS header</strong> is included for backward compatibility. Thus it can also be interpreted as an MS-DOS binary.</li>
<li>The main function of the MS-DOS header is to describe how to load and execute an <strong>MS-DOS stub</strong>, which comes right after the MSDOS header. This stub is usually just a small MS-DOS program, which is run instead of the main program when the user executes a PE binary in MSDOS. The MS-DOS stub program typically prints a string like “This program cannot be run in DOS mode” and then exits. However, in principle, it can be a full-fledged MS-DOS version of the program.</li>
<li>The MS-DOS header starts with a magic value, which consists of the ASCII characters <strong>MZ</strong>. For this reason, it’s also sometimes referred to as an <strong>MZ header</strong>.</li>
<li>The field <strong>e_lfanew</strong> contains the file offset at which the real PE binary begins. Thus, when a PE-aware program loader opens the binary, it can read the MS-DOS header and then skip past it and the MS-DOS stub to go right to the start of the PE headers.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="executable-header">Executable Header</h2>
<p>The struct <strong>IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64</strong> encompasses a 32- bit signature, a PE file header, and a PE optional header. You could say that struct IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64 as a whole is PE’s version of the executable header.</p>
<ul>
<li>The PE signature is simply a string containing the ASCII characters <strong>PE</strong>, followed by two NULL characters. It’s analogous to the magic bytes in the e_ident field in ELF’s executable header.</li>
<li>The file header describes general properties of the file. The most important fields are <em>Machine</em>, <em>NumberOfSections</em>, <em>SizeOfOptionalHeader</em>, and <em>Characteristics</em>.</li>
<li>The PE optional header provides metadata. It may be missing in object files.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section-header-table">Section Header Table</h2>
<ul>
<li>An array of <strong>IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER</strong> structures, each of which describes a single section, denoting its size in the file and in memory (SizeOfRawData and VirtualSize), its file offset and virtual address (PointerToRawData and VirtualAddress), relocation information, and any flags (Characteristics).
<ul>
<li>The flags describe whether the section is executable, readable, writable, or some combination of these.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of referring to a string table as the ELF section headers do, PE section headers specify the section name using a simple character array field, aptly called <em><strong>Name</strong></em>. Because the array is only 8 bytes long, PE section names are limited to 8 characters.</li>
<li>PE format does not explicitly distinguish between sections and segments. The closest thing PE files have to ELF’s execution view is the <strong>DataDirectory</strong>, which provides the loader with a shortcut to certain portions of the binary needed for setting up the execution.</li>
<li>There is no separate program header table; the section header table is used for both linking and loading.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>Many of the sections in PE files are directly comparable to ELF sections, often even having (almost) the same name.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>.idata</strong> section specifies which symbols (functions and data) the binary imports from shared libraries, or DLLs in Windows terminology.</li>
<li>The <strong>.edata</strong> section lists the symbols and their addresses that the binary exports.
<ul>
<li>To resolve references to external symbols, the loader needs to match up the required imports with the export table of the DLL that provides the required symbols.</li>
<li>In practice, you may find that the .idata and .edata sections are merged into .rdata, but their contents and workings remain the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the loader resolves dependencies, it writes the resolved addresses into the <strong>Import Address Table</strong> (<strong>IAT</strong>). Similar to the Global Offset Table in ELF, the IAT is simply a table of resolved pointers with one slot per pointer.
<ul>
<li>The IAT is also part of the .idata section, and it initially contains pointers to the names or identifying numbers of the symbols to be imported.</li>
<li>The dynamic loader then replaces these pointers with pointers to the actual imported functions or variables. A call to a library function is then implemented as a call to a <em><strong>thunk</strong></em> for that function, which is nothing more than an indirect jump through the IAT slot for the function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
