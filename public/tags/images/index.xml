      <description>&lt;p&gt;Static analysis is the analysis of an executable file on a structural bases without executing it in controlled environment. It is the analysis of the executable&amp;rsquo;s static attributes such as different sections and memory characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, static analysis of a PE allows extraction of a lot of metadata that can be useful in further analysis such as names of sections, imported DLLs and strings present which gives an early idea of the functions performed by the binary in question. Malicious binaries with unstructured and improperly formatted metadata (done to achieve sophisticated levels of obfuscation and anti-debugging/anti-reversing defenses) can raise suspicions since a benign PE generally has a well-formed and valid metadata. Therefore, static analysis has been a popular approach towards malware detection in PEs. Since execution of the binary is not required, this approach is much more lightweight and resource-conserving. This allows security teams and researchers quickly perform a preliminary analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
