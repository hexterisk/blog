      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classification of malware traffic has been a hot topic ever since machine learning was introduced to the world of network security domain. There are a number of published researches that explore various techniques to extract features from the traffic and use it classification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pre-machine learning era saw classification of traffic based on structured rule matching, &lt;strong&gt;DPI&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Deep Packet Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Port Inspection&lt;/strong&gt; being the most popular methods, which were typically rendered ineffective post-encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Malwares come in many forms. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a standalone binary whereas sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a legitimate software having a malware inside it. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a binary with malformed metadata and packed bytes to throw off the analyst whereas sometimes it acts as a downloader/launcher for a more malicious binary. Information extracted from static analysis can therefore be deemed unreliable and not as accurate when compared with information extracted from dynamic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Classification of Malwares through Static Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Static analysis is the analysis of an executable file on a structural bases without executing it in controlled environment. It is the analysis of the executable&amp;rsquo;s static attributes such as different sections and memory characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, static analysis of a PE allows extraction of a lot of metadata that can be useful in further analysis such as names of sections, imported DLLs and strings present which gives an early idea of the functions performed by the binary in question. Malicious binaries with unstructured and improperly formatted metadata (done to achieve sophisticated levels of obfuscation and anti-debugging/anti-reversing defenses) can raise suspicions since a benign PE generally has a well-formed and valid metadata. Therefore, static analysis has been a popular approach towards malware detection in PEs. Since execution of the binary is not required, this approach is much more lightweight and resource-conserving. This allows security teams and researchers quickly perform a preliminary analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
