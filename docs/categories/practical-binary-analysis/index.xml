      <description>A constraint solver must be versatile, that is, it should be able to act as an:
 Interpreter: Given the input, solve for the output of the equation. Inverter: Given the output, solve for the input of the equation. Synthesizer: Act as both Interpreter and Inverter.  Formulating Programs Assume a formula 𝑆ₚ(𝑥, 𝑦) which holds if and only if program P(x) outputs value y such that
Program: f(𝑥) { return 𝑥 + 𝑥 }</description>

      <title>Symbolic Execution and Angr</title>

      <description>Symbolic Execution is mainly focused on converting a program made up of a concrete set of instructions into an equation-like format. This is achieved with two core components:
Symbols Different values in a program(such as the user input) are substituted with Symbols(variables or placeholders). These symbols pertain to a domain full of values, allowing us to explore the program in a much more open form, basically “walking through the program” with a domain full of values(handled by any one of the constraint solving backends like Z3) instead of walking a fixed path due to a fixed hard-coded value/input.</description>
