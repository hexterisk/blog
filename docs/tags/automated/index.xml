      <description>DART Back in 2005, researchers at Microsoft came up with a concolic testing tool called DART(Directed Automated Random Testing). The tool can be used in the unit testing phase, as well as can be applied to large programs.
 We present a new tool, named DART, for automatically testing software that combines three main techniques: (1) automated extraction of the interface of a program with its external environment using static source-code parsing; (2) automatic generation of a test driver for this interface that performs random testing to simulate the most general environment the program can operate in; and (3) dynamic analysis of how the program behaves under random testing and automatic generation of new test inputs to direct systematically the execution along alternative program paths.</description>
