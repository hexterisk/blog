      <description>Malwares come in many forms. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a standalone binary whereas sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a legitimate software having a malware inside it. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a binary with malformed metadata and packed bytes to throw off the analyst whereas sometimes it acts as a downloader/launcher for a more malicious binary. Information extracted from static analysis can therefore be deemed unreliable and not as accurate when compared with information extracted from dynamic analysis.</description>

      <title>Classification of Malwares through Static Analysis</title>

      <description>Static analysis is the analysis of an executable file on a structural bases without executing it in controlled environment. It is the analysis of the executable&amp;rsquo;s static attributes such as different sections and memory characteristics.
Therefore, static analysis of a PE allows extraction of a lot of metadata that can be useful in further analysis such as names of sections, imported DLLs and strings present which gives an early idea of the functions performed by the binary in question.</description>

      <description>A common requirement in a large number of software projects is a relational database with an easy to use management tool. Considering how often a developer needs this, setting it up everytime from scratch can be a drag. However, with the advent of containerisation, we can have a setup off the ground in a couple of minutes, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a development or a production environment.
The age long discussion of MySQL versus MariaDB is something that an average developer need not bother with unless their requirement is very specific.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Taint Analysis and Pin</title>

      <description>Dynamic Taint Analysis is a technique used to discover what part of memory or register are controllable by the some data we are interested, such as the user input, at a given program state. This is done by marking the interested data. There on after, any piece of data that comes in contact with the tainted data by any means, like getting computed from the tainted data, is tainted too, thus spreading the taint throughout the execution.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Binary Instrumentation and Pin</title>

      <description>Dynamic Binary Instrumentation is the process of monitoring or measuring a binary&amp;rsquo;s execution and its behavior, such as resource usage, during runtime. It allows us to focus on specific parts of a binary for various purposes such as vulnerability analysis, dynamic tainting and state analysis.
We will skip over Source Instrumentation since it requires source code of the application, which is pretty rare in real world scenarios.
Instrumentation Code The technique requires injecting Instrumentation Code into a running binary.</description>

      <title>Source Code Instrumentation and LLVM</title>

      <description>Source Code Instrumentation adds specific code meant for instrumentation/analysis, called Instrumentation Code, to the source files of the program under consideration. The source files are then compiled and executed. Since the instrumentation code is integrated into the binary itself, the output from the execution includes the dump of the instrumentation code which can then be used for further analysis and component testing.

      <title>Symbolic Execution and Angr</title>

      <description>Symbolic Execution is mainly focused on converting a program made up of a concrete set of instructions into an equation-like format. This is achieved with two core components:
Symbols Different values in a program(such as the user input) are substituted with Symbols(variables or placeholders). These symbols pertain to a domain full of values, allowing us to explore the program in a much more open form, basically ‚Äúwalking through the program‚Äù with a domain full of values(handled by any one of the constraint solving backends like Z3) instead of walking a fixed path due to a fixed hard-coded value/input.</description>

      <title>Constraint Solvers and Z3</title>

      <description>A constraint solver must be versatile, that is, it should be able to act as an:
 Interpreter: Given the input, solve for the output of the equation. Inverter: Given the output, solve for the input of the equation. Synthesizer: Act as both Interpreter and Inverter.  Formulating Programs Assume a formula ùëÜ‚Çö(ùë•, ùë¶) which holds if and only if program P(x) outputs value y such that
Program: f(ùë•) { return ùë• + ùë• }</description>
