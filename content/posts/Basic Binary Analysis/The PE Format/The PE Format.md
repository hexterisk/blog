*   PE is a modified version of the **Common Object File Format** (**COFF**), thus also referred to as **PE/COFF**.
*   The 64-bit version of PE is called **PE32+.**
*   The structure is defined in **WinNT.h**, which is included in the **Microsoft Windows Software Developer Kit**.

_PE32+ binary structure._

*   An **MS-DOS header** is included for backward compatibility. Thus it can also be interpreted as an MS-DOS binary.
*   The main function of the MS-DOS header is to describe how to load and execute an **MS-DOS stub**, which comes right after the MSDOS header. This stub is usually just a small MS-DOS program, which is run instead of the main program when the user executes a PE binary in MSDOS. The MS-DOS stub program typically prints a string like “This program cannot be run in DOS mode” and then exits. However, in principle, it can be a full-fledged MS-DOS version of the program.
*   The MS-DOS header starts with a magic value, which consists of the ASCII characters **MZ**. For this reason, it’s also sometimes referred to as an **MZ header**.
*   The field **e\_lfanew** contains the file offset at which the real PE binary begins. Thus, when a PE-aware program loader opens the binary, it can read the MS-DOS header and then skip past it and the MS-DOS stub to go right to the start of the PE headers.

## Executable Header

The struct **IMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS64** encompasses a 32- bit signature, a PE file header, and a PE optional header. You could say that struct IMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS64 as a whole is PE’s version of the executable header.

*   The PE signature is simply a string containing the ASCII characters **PE**, followed by two NULL characters. It’s analogous to the magic bytes in the e\_ident field in ELF’s executable header.
*   The file header describes general properties of the file. The most important fields are _Machine_, _NumberOfSections_, _SizeOfOptionalHeader_, and _Characteristics_.
*   The PE optional header provides metadata. It may be missing in object files.

## Section Header Table

*   An array of **IMAGE\_SECTION\_HEADER** structures, each of which describes a single section, denoting its size in the file and in memory (SizeOfRawData and VirtualSize), its file offset and virtual address (PointerToRawData and VirtualAddress), relocation information, and any flags (Characteristics).
    *   The flags describe whether the section is executable, readable, writable, or some combination of these.
*   Instead of referring to a string table as the ELF section headers do, PE section headers specify the section name using a simple character array field, aptly called _**Name**_. Because the array is only 8 bytes long, PE section names are limited to 8 characters.
*   PE format does not explicitly distinguish between sections and segments. The closest thing PE files have to ELF’s execution view is the **DataDirectory**, which provides the loader with a shortcut to certain portions of the binary needed for setting up the execution.
*   There is no separate program header table; the section header table is used for both linking and loading.

&nbsp;

## Sections

Many of the sections in PE files are directly comparable to ELF sections, often even having (almost) the same name.

*   The **.idata** section specifies which symbols (functions and data) the binary imports from shared libraries, or DLLs in Windows terminology.
*   The **.edata** section lists the symbols and their addresses that the binary exports.
    *   To resolve references to external symbols, the loader needs to match up the required imports with the export table of the DLL that provides the required symbols.
    *   In practice, you may find that the .idata and .edata sections are merged into .rdata, but their contents and workings remain the same.
*   When the loader resolves dependencies, it writes the resolved addresses into the **Import Address Table** (**IAT**). Similar to the Global Offset Table in ELF, the IAT is simply a table of resolved pointers with one slot per pointer.
    *   The IAT is also part of the .idata section, and it initially contains pointers to the names or identifying numbers of the symbols to be imported.
    *   The dynamic loader then replaces these pointers with pointers to the actual imported functions or variables. A call to a library function is then implemented as a call to a _**thunk**_ for that function, which is nothing more than an indirect jump through the IAT slot for the function.
