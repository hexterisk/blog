An general overview of the Design Patterns.

## Classification

### Purpose

**Purpose** reflects the use case of a design pattern.

**Creational Pattern** concerns the process of object creation.

**Structural Pattern** deals with the composition of classes or objects.

**Behavioral Pattern** characterizes the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.

### Scope

The scope of a design patterns specifies where it is primarily applied.

**Class Pattern** deals with relationships between classes and their sub-classes. They are established through inheritance, and are therefore statically bound during compile-time.

**Object Pattern** deals with object relationships. They are established during run-time, and are therefore dynamic and changeable.

**Creational Class Pattern** defers some part of object creation to child classes, while **Creational Object Pattern** defers it to another object. 

**Structural Class Pattern** uses inheritance to compose classes, while **Structural Object Pattern** describes ways to assemble objects. 

**Behavioral Class Pattern** uses inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas **Behavioral Object Pattern** describes how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone.
