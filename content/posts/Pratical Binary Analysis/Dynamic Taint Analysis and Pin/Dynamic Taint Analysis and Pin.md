**Dynamic Taint Analysis** is a technique used to discover what part of memory or register are controllable by the some data we are interested, such as the user input, at a given program state. This is done by marking the interested data. There on after, any piece of data that comes in contact with the tainted data by any means, like getting computed from the tainted data, is tainted too, thus spreading the taint throughout the execution.

Regions of interest are:

*   Taint Sources: Program, or memory locations, where data of interest enter the system and subsequently get tagged.
*   Taint Tracking: Process of propagating data tags according to program semantics.
*   Taint Sinks: Program, or memory locations, where checks for tagged data can be made.

Dynamic Taint Analysis requires a Dynamic Binary Instrumentation framework as a prerequisite. We'll use Intel Pin.

## Shadow Memory

It is the technique in which potentially every byte used by a program has a mirror byte during it's execution. These shadow bytes can be used to record information about their original counterparts, since these bytes are invisible to the program. We create a user shadow memory to mark all the addresses that can be tainted by the data in question.

&nbsp;

## Example

We'll need the help of a DBI to retrieve information before and after each function is called. We'll resort to using Pin to taint user input and track it through the execution of the binary.

We'll write a simple C++ program that reads content from a file, sends it around two functions as transfers the data into different buffers and then prints the contents onto the console. The name of the source code file is _sample.cpp_.

```c
// sample.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

void foo1(char *temp, char *source){
    
    memcpy(temp, source, strlen(source));
    return;
}

void foo2(char *sink, char *temp){
    
    memcpy(sink, temp, strlen(temp));
    return ;
}

int main(int ac, char **av)
{
    int fd;
    char source[256], sink[256], temp[256];

    fd = open("./input.txt", O_RDONLY);
    read(fd, source, 256), close(fd);

    foo1(temp, source);
    foo2(sink, temp);

    fd = open("./output.txt", O_WRONLY);
    write(fd, sink, strlen(sink)), close(fd);

    std::cout << sink;

    return 0;
}
```

Create an input file named _input.txt_, add some content to it. Create an output file named _output.txt_. The source code is pretty straightforward.

Let's write a Pintool to taint and track the input data, named _tool.cpp_.

```c
// tool.cpp

#include "pin.H"
#include <asm/unistd.h>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

/* bytes range tainted */
struct range
{
  UINT64 start;
  UINT64 end;
};

std::list<struct range> bytesTainted;

INT32 Usage()
{
    std::cerr << "Ex 1" << std::endl;
    return -1;
}

VOID ReadMem(UINT64 insAddr, std::string insDis, UINT64 memOp)
{
  std::list<struct range>::iterator i;
  UINT64 addr = memOp;
  
  for(i = bytesTainted.begin(); i != bytesTainted.end(); ++i){
      if (addr >= i->start && addr < i->end){
        std::cout << std::hex << "[READ in " << addr << "]\t" << insAddr << ": " << insDis<< std::endl;
      }
  } 
}

VOID WriteMem(UINT64 insAddr, std::string insDis, UINT64 memOp)
{
  std::list<struct range>::iterator i;
  UINT64 addr = memOp;

  for(i = bytesTainted.begin(); i != bytesTainted.end(); ++i){
      if (addr >= i->start && addr < i->end){
        std::cout << std::hex << "[WRITE in " << addr << "]\t" << insAddr << ": " << insDis << std::endl;
      }
  } 
}

VOID Instruction(INS ins, VOID *v)
{
  if (INS_MemoryOperandIsRead(ins, 0) && INS_OperandIsReg(ins, 0)){
    INS_InsertCall(
        ins, IPOINT_BEFORE, (AFUNPTR)ReadMem,
        IARG_ADDRINT, INS_Address(ins),
        IARG_PTR, new std::string(INS_Disassemble(ins)),
        IARG_MEMORYOP_EA, 0,
        IARG_END);
  }
  else if (INS_MemoryOperandIsWritten(ins, 0)){
    INS_InsertCall(
        ins, IPOINT_BEFORE, (AFUNPTR)WriteMem,
        IARG_ADDRINT, INS_Address(ins),
        IARG_PTR, new std::string(INS_Disassemble(ins)),
        IARG_MEMORYOP_EA, 0,
        IARG_END);
  }
}

static unsigned int lock;

#define TRICKS(){if (lock++ == 0)return;}

/* Taint from Syscalls */
VOID Syscall_entry(THREADID thread_id, CONTEXT *ctx, SYSCALL_STANDARD std, void *v)
{
  struct range taint;

  /* Taint from read */
  if (PIN_GetSyscallNumber(ctx, std) == __NR_read){

      TRICKS();

      taint.start = static_cast<UINT64>((PIN_GetSyscallArgument(ctx, std, 1)));
      taint.end   = taint.start + static_cast<UINT64>((PIN_GetSyscallArgument(ctx, std, 2)));
      bytesTainted.push_back(taint);
      std::cout << "[TAINT]\t\t\tbytes tainted from " << std::hex << "0x" << taint.start << " to 0x" << taint.end << " (via read)"<< std::endl;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if(PIN_Init(argc, argv)){
        return Usage();
    }
    
    PIN_SetSyntaxIntel();
    PIN_AddSyscallEntryFunction(Syscall_entry, 0);
    INS_AddInstrumentFunction(Instruction, 0);
    PIN_StartProgram();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Some new methods have been used. I'll address them.

The main function, `main`, is responsible to get Pin ready and started.

*   `PIN_AddSyscallEntryFunction`:
    *   Registers a function to be called immediately before execution of a system call.

The pre-syscall handler function, `Syscall_entry`, checks if the syscall is a _read_, and taints the data accordingly. Uses a list where it inserts structured entries of starting and ending addresses

*   `PIN_GetSyscallNumber`:
    *   Retrieves the syscall number, which is then checked against the number for _read_.
*   `PIN_GetSyscallArgument`:
    *   Get the value of the argument of the system call to be executed in the specified context. The change would generally be in the third argument, which is the ordinal number of the argument whose value is requested.

The instrumentation function, `Instruction`, cycles through all instructions and registers a callback depending on the instruction belonging to a _read_ or _write_ call.

*   `INS_MemoryOperandIsRead`:
    *   Checks if memory operand **memopIdx** is read. It controls which memory operand to rewrite.
*   `INS_OperandIsReg`:
    *   Checks if this operand is a register.
*   `INS_MemoryOperandIsWritten`:
    *   Checks if memory operand **memopIdx** is written.

The analysis functions, `ReadMem` and `WriteMem`, simply iterates through the list of tainted addresses and prints the current instruction's address out if it's working with the tainted data or address. The first one checks if the accesses memory is in the tainted area, while the second one checks if the address being written to is in the tainted area.

The output is as follows.

And there we have all the interactions with the tainted area.
